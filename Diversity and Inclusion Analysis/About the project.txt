Project Description:
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of gender diversity and inclusion within a bank, focusing on key metrics related to gender-based participation, hiring practices, promotions, and employee turnover. The objective was to identify areas of disparity and provide actionable insights to enhance inclusivity within the organization.

Key Actions and Findings:

Gender-Based Participation Analysis:
* Evaluated the distribution of male and female employees across various job roles and positions.
* Found that male employees significantly outnumbered female employees, with counts of 49.17 for males and 34.17 for females, indicating a gender disparity in overall employee numbers.

Hiring Practices Evaluation:
* Analyzed hiring ratios to determine gender balance in recruitment processes.
* Identified a substantial imbalance, with males being hired at a higher rate than females.

Promotion Trends Assessment:
* Investigated gender-based promotion trends within the organization.
* Discovered that females made up 20.09% of Junior Officers, a figure that may impact turnover rates and overall career progression.

Employee Turnover Analysis:
* Examined employee turnover rates by gender to understand retention patterns.
* Highlighted potential issues in retaining female talent, as indicated by the lower average count of female employee IDs.

Recommendations for Improvement:
* Provided a set of recommended solutions aimed at improving gender inclusivity and reducing disparities.
* Suggested strategies for more balanced recruitment, equitable promotion practices, and initiatives to enhance female retention.

Technologies Used:
MS Excel:
* Utilized vlookups and other functions for data preparation and initial analysis.

PowerBI:
* Employed DAX for advanced calculations and metrics.
* Used PowerQuery for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
* Developed data models to visualize and analyze the data effectively.
