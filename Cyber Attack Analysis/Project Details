Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing cyber attack patterns and trends within a multinational organization with offices across different countries. By leveraging multiple datasets,
I need to provide insights into the nature of these attacks, their impact on various departments, and the vulnerabilities in different systems and devices.The goal is to enhance the organization's
security posture, educate employees, and improve security device configurations.

Tools and Technologies Used:

1. Microsoft Excel
   - Used for initial data preparation and cleaning.
   - Employed various lookup functions and formulas to organize and preprocess the data.
   - Performed preliminary analysis to identify trends and patterns.

2. SQL Server
   - Utilized for advanced data manipulation and storage.
   - Worked with Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and various table JOINs to combine and query large datasets.
   - Enhanced core SQL skills to derive meaningful insights from the data.
   - Data was stored and queried in a relational database to ensure efficient handling of large volumes of data.

3. Power BI
   - Connected to SQL Server to load and visualize data.
   - Extensively used for data visualization to create interactive dashboards and reports.
   - Developed complex DAX measures for dynamic calculations across reports.
   - Addressed issues such as ambiguous table relationships, joining different fact tables, and managing many-to-many relationships.

Data Sources and Structure:

1. System Attacks Dataset:
   - Contains records of attacks on employee systems.
   - Fields: Source and destination IPs, date and time of attack, source and destination ports, device status (registered/unregistered), protocols, packet flow information, traffic type, malware indicators,
     anomaly scores, alerts, severity levels, attack type and signature, actions taken, device and browser information, operating systems, network segments, and log source devices.

2. Device Attacks Dataset:
   - Records attacks on employee mobile devices.
   - Fields: Source and destination IPs, source and destination ports, protocol, device status, date and time of attacks, packet details (incoming and outgoing), FLAG counts, segment and header sizes,
     attack labels (adware, scareware, SMS malware, benign).

3. Dept. Info Dataset:
   - Maps employee IP addresses to departments and countries.
   - Provides insights into which departments and countries are affected by attacks.

4. Office Country Dataset:
   - Contains data on office locations, office codes by country, and the number of employees in each office.
   - Helps in understanding the geographical distribution of attacks.

Analysis Conducted:

1. Attack Patterns and Trends
   - Identified peak periods for cyber attacks by analyzing date and time data.
   - Examined which country offices and departments experienced the highest frequency of attacks.
   - Analyzed the most common protocols and ports targeted by attackers.

2. Severity and Impact Assessment
   - Categorized attacks based on severity to prioritize response efforts.
   - Analyzed anomaly scores and alerts to gauge the impact of detected threats.

3. Attack Types and Malware Indicators
   - Identified common attack signatures and types, such as adware, scareware, and SMS malware.
   - Examined malware indicators to understand the types of malicious software used.

4. Employee and Device Vulnerability
   - Differentiated between attacks on registered vs. unregistered devices.
   - Identified which operating systems and browsers were most frequently targeted.

5. Network and Segment Analysis
   - Analyzed which network segments were most vulnerable.
   - Identified primary sources of logs to understand where most attacks were detected.

Key Findings:

1. Correlation of Attacks
   - System and device attacks are positively correlated, indicating simultaneous targeting.

2. Unregistered Devices at Higher Risk
   - Unregistered devices faced significantly more attacks than registered devices.

3. Departmental Vulnerabilities
   - The Engineering department experienced the highest number of system and device attacks.
   - Windows OS was the most frequently targeted operating system.

4. Attack Trends by Month
   - March had the highest number of system attacks, while December had the lowest.

5. Protocol and Attack Types
   - Adware attacks in the TCP protocol were the most common.
   - Forward and backward packet analysis showed significant divergence in adware attacks.

6. Employee Impact
   - Over half of the employees (59.75%) faced cyber attacks.
   - A larger percentage of device attacks were on unregistered devices compared to system attacks.

Recommendations:

1. Enhance Security Protocols for Unregistered Devices
   - Implement stricter security measures for unregistered devices, including mandatory registration and regular security updates, to reduce their vulnerability to attacks.

2. Conduct Regular Security Training
   - Provide ongoing security awareness training for employees, particularly in departments like Engineering that are most affected, to educate them on recognizing and mitigating cyber threats.

3. Improve Monitoring and Defense Mechanisms
   - Upgrade security device configurations to better detect and block attacks, focusing on commonly targeted protocols and operating systems.
   - Ensure continuous monitoring of network segments and traffic.

Conclusion:

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of cyber attacks within a multinational organization, highlighting key vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.
By leveraging tools like Microsoft Excel, SQL Server, and Power BI, we were able to derive meaningful insights and offer actionable recommendations to enhance the organization's security posture,
educate employees, and improve security device configurations.
