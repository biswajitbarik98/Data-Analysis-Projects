This project is based on a U.S e-Commerce dataset fetched from Kaggle. I added some more information to the dataset like calculation of costs, shipping prices as per the shipping mode, and some basic stuff.

I have performed:

⭐ #Datacleaning and #Transformation in PowerQuery
⭐ Analysed #KPIs using #SQL
⭐ #Datavisualization
⭐ #DAX calculations with various filters
⭐ Dynamic dashboard and visual titles using parameters
⭐ Page navigation and bookmarks

I worked on this project to analyse the following things:
 
🎯 Sales, profit, cost, and quantity by category, segment, city, and products
🎯 Top 5 Products by all the parameters
🎯 Segment and product/category need more attention to increase sales and profit.
🎯 Used DAX to calculate YoY% of Growth of Sales, Profit, Cost, and Quantity
🎯 Comparison between year-wise last month’s sales, profit, cost, and quantity
